# Refactor - Next.js TypeScript Analyzer: Project Tasklist

## Overview
This document outlines the tasks that have been completed and those that remain to be done for the Refactor project, based on the PRD requirements.

## Completed Tasks

### Frontend Implementation
- ✅ Set up Vite React project with TypeScript
- ✅ Implemented Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI for styling
- ✅ Created main application layout with tabbed interface
- ✅ Implemented project selection dialog (ProjectSelector)
- ✅ Implemented main header/navigation (AnalyzerHeader)
- ✅ Created the following visualizer components (all feature-complete for frontend):
  - ✅ Structure Visualizer (interactive file/directory tree, file badges, preview)
  - ✅ Component Visualizer (component hierarchy, props, relationships, React Flow)
  - ✅ Dependency Visualizer (dependency graph, Mermaid preview, filtering)
  - ✅ SOLID Visualizer (SOLID analysis, scores, issues, recommendations)
  - ✅ Refactor Visualizer (suggestions, before/after code, impact stats, diagrams, export)
- ✅ Implemented React Query for state management
- ✅ Set up basic routing with React Router

**Note:** All core frontend visualizer and UI tasks are complete. Further frontend work (real data, advanced search, error handling) depends on backend/API integration.

## Remaining Tasks

### Frontend Tasks
- ✅ Component Visualizer implementation (hierarchy, relationships, props, React Flow)
- ✅ Dependency Visualizer implementation (module graph, Mermaid, filtering)
- ✅ SOLID Visualizer implementation (principle displays, issue highlighting, severity)
- ✅ Refactor Visualizer implementation (suggestion cards, before/after, prioritization, export)
- ✅ Search functionality (basic in visualizers)
- ✅ Interactive features (zoom, pan, click in visualizations where applicable)
- 📝 Implement data fetching from backend API (pending backend)

### Backend Tasks
- 📝 Set up Node.js/Express.js server
- 📝 Implement file system interface for reading project files
- 📝 Create TypeScript parser using @typescript-eslint/typescript-estree
- 📝 Develop core analysis modules:
  - 📝 Structure Analyzer
  - 📝 Component Analyzer
  - 📝 Route Analyzer
  - 📝 TypeScript Analyzer
  - 📝 Dependency Analyzer
  - 📝 SOLID Analyzer
  - 📝 Refactor Analyzer
- 📝 Implement analysis cache for storing results
- 📝 Create visualization data generators
- 📝 Set up API endpoints for frontend communication

### Integration Tasks
- 📝 Connect frontend to backend API
- 📝 Implement error handling and loading states
- 📝 Add real-time analysis updates
- 📝 Create comprehensive testing suite
- 📝 Optimize performance for large projects

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Analysis Framework (In Progress)
- ✅ Frontend UI framework setup
- ✅ Basic visualization components
- 📝 Backend structure analysis
- 📝 Project file scanning

### Phase 2: Enhanced Visualizations
- 📝 Component dependency graphs
- 📝 Route structure visualizations
- 📝 Interactive exploration features

### Phase 3: Advanced Analysis
- 📝 Dependency mapping visualization
- 📝 TypeScript type relationship analysis
- 📝 Performance optimizations

### Phase 4: SOLID Analysis & Refactoring
- 📝 SOLID principles analyzers
- 📝 Refactoring suggestions
- 📝 Refactor View implementation

## Next Steps
1. Complete the backend setup to enable actual project analysis
2. Implement the Structure Analyzer to provide real data to the Structure Visualizer
3. Develop the Component Analyzer to enable the Component Visualizer
4. Continue with the remaining analyzers in priority order

## Notes
- The frontend shell is in place with placeholder visualizers
- Backend development needs to be prioritized to enable real data analysis
- Consider implementing analyzers incrementally to provide value early
